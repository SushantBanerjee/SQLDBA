If the database in secondary node is in not sync in secondary

- check if SQL Service is running on secondary node
- Check if Sync is Paused, if yes, then Resume it

- if the above 2 donot work, then need to restore FULL + DIFF + LOG backup from primary to secondary
  - we cannot directly restore on secondary node because it gives below error
    Error: BACKUP or RESTORE command is not supported on a database mirror or secondary replica

  - to over come this run the following in the secondary node
    - ALTER DATABASE DMAT SET HADR OFF; 
   
  - then restore FULL backup with NORECOVEY and REPLACE command
    RESTORE DATABASE [DMAT] FROM DISK = N'\\172.31.16.160\f$\Backup\Full_Backup\DMAT_01.bak' 
    WITH  FILE = 1,  NORECOVERY,  NOUNLOAD,  REPLACE,  STATS = 5

  - Take DIFF backup on PRIMARY
    BACKUP DATABASE [DMAT] TO DISK = N'F:\Backup\Diff_Backup\DMAT_Diff_01.bak' WITH COMPRESSION, DIFFERENTIAL

  - then restore DIFF backup with NORECOVEY command
    RESTORE DATABASE [DMAT] FROM DISK = N'\\172.31.16.160\f$\Backup\Diff_Backup\DMAT_01.bak' 
    WITH  NORECOVERY, STATS = 5

  - Take LOGbackup on PRIMARY
    BACKUP LOG [DMAT] TO DISK = N'F:\Backup\Log_Backup\DMAT_Log_01.trn'  with COMPRESSION

  - then restore Log backup
    RESTORE LOG [DMAT] FROM DISK = N'\\172.31.16.160\f$\Backup\Log_Backup\DMAT_01.trn' WITH NORECOVERY
    Take another log backup on PRIMARY and restore on Secondary
    RESTORE LOG [DMAT] FROM DISK = N'\\172.31.16.160\f$\Backup\Log_Backup\DMAT_02.trn' WITH NORECOVERY

  - Repeat the above 2 step atleat 2-3 times with different file names

  - Make sure that automated log backups are disabled before you start Differential backup

- run the below command to join the database to AG

  ALTER DATABASE DMAT SET HADR AVAILABILITY GROUP = ABMUBODPAGL01;  
  OR
  Right click on the database in Availablity databases and click on [Join]
